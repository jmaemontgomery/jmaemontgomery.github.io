My abstract was selected for a platform talk at the Biophysical Society 66th Annual Meeting. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, this was my first in-person confrence of graduate school. My talk centered on results from unbiased molecular dynamics simulations of amino acid sidechain analogs in a POPC bilayer using the Drude polarizable force field. Slides availaible upon request.
