I had the privilege of presenting a 1 hour departmental seminar on the progress of my research work. Our department is very interdiciplinary, which means it can be difficult to make sure everyone is on the same page. I made it my intention to not only present my research, but ensure the audience was with me and understood the purpose of my work. The seminar was well recieved, and gave individuals a new perspective on biophysics and molecular dynamics simulations. Slides available upon request.
