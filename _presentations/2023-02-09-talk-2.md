I was one of 30 graduate students participating in the 2023 Nutshell Games. We had to summarize our research to a non-technical audience in 90 seconds, with the judges ranging from the dean of the graduate school, to a 5th grader from a local elementary school. While a challenge in scientific communications, it was an important reminder of the impact of our work, and how we can best share it with the general public.
