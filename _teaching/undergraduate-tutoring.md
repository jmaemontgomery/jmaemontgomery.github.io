I was selected to serve in this role from my professors for my junior and senior years of undergrad. I was responsible for teaching voulentary and probitionary students who came to our office. I also provided testing accomedations, such as reading, writing, and clarifying examinations. 

I often found myself requested by name, and I worked with my supervisor to provide larger, focused groups in addition to one-on-one tutoring.
