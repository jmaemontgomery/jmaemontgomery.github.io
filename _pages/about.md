My Background
======

My journey started at [St. Joseph's University](https://www.sjny.edu/long-island) in Patchouge, New York where I studied Chemistry through their biochemistry sequence. Being a first-gen student meant that the idea of academia was completely forigen to me, and my career path was initially focused on becoming a veterinarian. Thanks to having the opportunity to be in a lab managment role for the physical sciences department and do a senior thesis, I realized research is where I wanted to be. 

I joined the Lemkul lab at [Virginia Tech Biochemistry](https://www.biochem.vt.edu/) in Blacksburg, Virginia. I had never touched dry lab work before, but found computational chemistry during my rotation in the lab, and was hooked. I had the privilege of starting the membrane & membrane protein arm of the lab, of which my project plans afforded me an [NSF Fellowship](https://news.vt.edu/articles/2021/11/cals-bchm-nsf-grfp-fellow.html). I currently focus on polarizable simulations of membrane proteins, like GPCRs and model peptides. 

I am passionate for accessible, efficient, and well-documented tech. Coming into scientific computing with only my teenage-self-taught HTML and CSS skills (so nothing) meant there were massive barriers to overcome, and working with tools that were poorly documented made it only harder. By providing accessible documentation, that barrier can be lowered for future learners, and enable historically disadvantaged groups to hone their skills without hidden cirriculum getting in the way. 


Personal Interests 
======

Outside of my work, I love animals, video games/board games, cooking, and traveling. My dog, Athena, knows far too much about biophysics thanks to her being my practice audience. She gives quite good feedback, too.
