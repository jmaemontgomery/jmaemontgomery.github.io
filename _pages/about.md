My Background
======

My journey started at [St. Joseph's University](https://www.sjny.edu/long-island) in Patchogue, New York where I studied Chemistry through their biochemistry sequence. I am a first-gen student, and that meant the idea of academia was completely foreign to me, and my career path was initially focused on professional school. Thanks to having the opportunity of working in a lab management role for the physical sciences department along side doing a senior research-based thesis, I realized research was where I wanted to be.

I joined the Lemkul lab at [Virginia Tech Biochemistry](https://www.biochem.vt.edu/) in Blacksburg, Virginia. I had never touched dry lab work before, but found computational chemistry during my rotation in the lab, and was hooked. I had the privilege of starting the membrane protein arm of the lab, of which my project plans afforded me an [NSF Fellowship](https://news.vt.edu/articles/2021/11/cals-bchm-nsf-grfp-fellow.html). I currently focus on polarizable simulations of GPCRs and model peptides.

I am passionate about accessible, efficient, and well-documented tech. Coming into scientific computing with very little self-taught coding experience meant there were massive barriers to overcome, and working with tools that were poorly documented made it only harder. By providing accessible documentation, that barrier can be lowered for future learners, and enable historically disadvantaged groups to hone their skills without hidden curriculum getting in the way.

What are some things I did during my Ph.D.?
======

I've been responsible for setting up the membrane protein arm of [the Lemkul Lab](https://www.thelemkullab.com/). We use the Drude Polarizable Force Field to explore the underlying electrostatic interactions of biological systems. The long-term goal is for a more complete understanding of systems where polarization responses are important in biological processes.

This meant I got the chance to work with small molecules, model peptides, and large proteins in the context of membranes. I extended our workflows and established protocols to work with membranes. A critical point of using a polarizable force field is how expensive they can be; Drude adds an additional particle for every non-hydrogen atom in the system. As such, I had to make sure I was using my resources efficiently. I would develop a prototype of [TUPÃƒ](https://github.com/mdpoleto/tupa), an intrinsic electric field analysis tool, to be parallelized over multiple CPUs using the multiprocessing Python package. I also helped and encouraged the adoption of parallelizing over multiple GPUs with [OpenMM](https://openmm.org/), benchmarking increases of 50-60% in simulation speed. 

Parallelization isn't cheap, and while the Lemkul Lab is lucky to have access to [Virginia Tech Advanced Research Computing](https://arc.vt.edu/) clusters, it isn't always enough for all the things going on in the lab. I am lucky that I started when I did, as the [NSF ACCESS](https://access-ci.org/) program began accepting graduate student-led proposals, and thanks to my fellowship, I could apply for a Discover-level allocation. This meant I could get over 27,000 GPU hours on clusters like [SDSC Expanse](https://www.sdsc.edu/support/user_guides/expanse.html). With this allocation, I have been able to start running polarizable simulations of a G-Protein Coupled Receptor (GPCR).

In line with accessible and documented tech, I spent time in my graduate career renovating our lab tutorial work, expanding it to apply to our new workflows, and separating it from our internal lab wiki. This meant students had a clear path through their rotation of the skills they were expected to learn, and resources to continue their education if they decided to join us. I've been lucky to train several students directly, including a few rotation students, a visiting Ph.D. student, and an undergrad. I've learned just as much as they've taught me and found myself working on and learning about sodium channels, antimicrobial peptides, and ion parameter validation. 

I am currently working on 2 first author publications that (fingers crossed!) should be submitted by the time I defend. I will also have work related to GPCR simulations that we will seek to publish in 2024 after finishing my Ph.D. in May.


Personal Interests 
======

Outside of my work, I love animals, video games/board games, cooking, and traveling. My dog, Athena, knows far too much about biophysics thanks to her being my practice audience. She gives quite good feedback, too.
