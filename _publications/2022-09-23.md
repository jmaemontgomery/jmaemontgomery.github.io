This paper seeked to understand familial Alzheimer’s Disease mutations on its folding free energy in the context of a polarizable force field. This study showed the link between backbone and side chain polarization and depolarization on the conformational ensemble of different amyloid β mutants. I was responsible for running some preliminary simulations of one of the mutants, as well as some data analysis and paper revisions.
