This paper focused on using a polarizable force field to understand the effect of explict polarization on the permiation of amino acid analogs. We compared the results to the CHARMM36 force field, and saw a marked difference in the way the force fields modelled the permiation polar, aromatic, and negatively charged analogs. We employed both unbiased and umbrella sampling simulations to characterize the permiation process. I was responsible for all aspects of the paper, including preparing the simulations, analyzing the simulations, and writing the paper.
